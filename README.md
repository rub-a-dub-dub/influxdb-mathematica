influxdb-mathematica
====================

This is an InfluxDB Import Filter for Mathematica 10. You use the ImportString[] command along with an InfluxDB query and get a TimeSeries object back.

To install, copy Import.m and Converter.m into $UserBaseDirectory/SystemFiles/Formats/InfluxDB. Create the directory tree as needed if not present.
